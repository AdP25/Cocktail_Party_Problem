# Cocktail_Party_Problem

At a crowded party or in a noisy restaurant, most of us do something remarkable. Out of all the sounds and voices around us, we can attribute them to distinct sources, and even attend to one specific speaker in a group and ignore the rest. In 1953, British scientist Colin Cherry named this phenomenon the “cocktail party problem” (or the problem of source separation), and since then it has been a topic of study in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and biology.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have increasingly been applied to recordings of animal sounds, redefining the state-of-the-art in tasks such as sound event detection and classification. The cocktail party problem — the problem of isolating and recognizing individual “speakers” (or more general: sound sources) from a recording with overlapping signals — has historically presented a major challenge in the processing of animal sound data.
